/**
 * MotorTuner is a utility that helps you tune the closed loop control gains of a motor controller. Specifically, it
 * sends various variables (e.g., current gains, position, velocity, acceleration, time, etc.) to the driver station
 * over a simple socket that is then read and graphed. This utility visualizes motor movement in real time and allows
 * you to easily make fine adjustments to the gains.
